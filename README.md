# BK Blueprint
WordPress Development Starter Theme
-----

This is an exceptionally opinionated project that is simply my starting point for most WordPress projects.
This matches my workflow, which is evolving, but I will try to document it as best I can here. This may not match
the way you think or code, but this is how I work. For now.

## Tools & Apps
I'm not big on using a lot of specialized tools to make this work, as I don't want to create dependencies on a specific machine, etc.
