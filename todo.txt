# Things That Need doing

- update SVG icon strings in svg-icons.php

- refactor the file tree -- how am I really organizing Things
- refactor SASS structure
- find code that needs to be moved to basic functionality plugin
- check template cascade to make sure that I have bare minimum of pages and no more
- add a front-page, because that always seems to be needed
- consider a way to add recommended plugins
- add ARIA labels -- https://a11yproject.com/posts/aria-landmark-roles/ --- https://a11yproject.com/checklist
